You just need to "coregister only".  Reslicing anatomical images is
really only needed when using software outside SPM, which may not be
able to understand the orientation information in the image headers (or
mat files for older SPM versions).

If you suffer utterly evil --yet, not so anatomically plausible-- mis-registration
problems, then maybe your nifti orientation meta-data are just gabbage. Zap'em by
running fslorient -deleteorient, or some other snub; SPM will figure out the correct
orientation by itself.
